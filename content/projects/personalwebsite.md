## About

I created the website you are currently browsing from scratch, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go.
The website is hosted on Github pages, and the source is available at <https://github.com/m0ose01/m0ose01.github.io>.

## Installation

See instructions on the repository's [README](https://github.com/m0ose01/m0ose01.github.io#readme).
