# My Personal Website

This is a very basic personal website which I use to showcase my work.

## Installation

If you would like to use this website as a jumping-off point for your own, you can clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m0ose01/m0ose01.github.io
```

Then, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation), and run `hugo server` in the cloned directory.
This starts a local webserver, which you can browse at `localhost:1313`.
